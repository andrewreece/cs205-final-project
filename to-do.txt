CS205 TO-DO NOV 26:

do more testing on make_json in spark-output.py, this seems to be where the error is that keeps showing up in your spark feed, about "No JSON could be found", something like that.

figure out this lambda thing with spark map(). it doesn't look like you need to have everything always in this 'return lambda' formula, and it may be unnecessarily complicated syntax. 
	look at filter_tweets and get_relevant_fields in spark-output.py for examples of this
	
do we really want to ignore tweets with no geolocation or location field?

make sure that adding an extra parameter along with iterator doesn't break write_to_db in spark-output.py. 

move twitter api creds to s3 file and read into twitter-in.py (they're currently posted directly in the script)

make sure all your functions still work, in particular main.js, twitter-in and spark-out.
you didn't just comment on your travel day, but you helpfully consolidated things and made them more efficient.  but you were also jet-lagged.  so.
