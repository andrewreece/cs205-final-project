My body is&&&&&ready! #GOPDebate Trump probably got more money than all them candidates combined #GOPDebate is like vinyl vs digital, Serato vs Traktor, and so on and so forth an entertaining distraction from what really matters. Before everyone starts tweeting about&&&&&the debate, I propose getting rid of Trump and Hillary and starting from scratch. For America's sake //So yeah, @CalfCorset. I don't know who you are nor what your problem is but please move along. I don't need random encounters&&&&&like this. @DWStweets we really, really want to live tweet some Dem debates sooner rather than later. #ldsdems #p2 #CNNDebate The debate isn't as bad I thought it'd be...

Huh. #GOPDebate The only authentic thing&&&&&onstage is that plane. #GOPDebate @tedcruz is a humble man Let's see how the #GOPDebate celebrates Mexican Independence today. Who's watching the #GOPDebate CNN really went overboard on the intro to the first debate. Had a movie announcer voice and&&&&&sounded like a superbowl ad. #GOPDebate "He came off as human." -compliment for republican candidates. Dr. Ben Carson #winbenwin I don't get it? Is CNN trying to remind us that they finally found the plane? #GOPDebate #TooSoonSorry Imagining this crew&&&&&posing in America's Next Model #GOPDebate #CNNDebate #bobbyjindal rocks he is such a doer! Okay time to go into hibernation for 50 days and come back randomly! Ciao!

Ronald Reagan Donald Trump walking in like he owns the place. He doesn't. @WC_Simons Carson is way too soft spoken&&&&&ITS ABOUT TO GETTING REAL #GOPDebate I thought that was an Air Force 1 in the background, not a clown car #CNNDebate contrary to others I appreciate that Gov Kasich has experience as a Banker. #GOPDebate The Donald looks like&&&&&he's cracking jokes up there. My kinda guy. #CNNDebate Watching the Candidates take the stage just now gave me flashbacks of the Iceland Team from Mighty Ducks II. #GOPDebate The plane is HILARIOUS!! #GOPDebate #SF #LGBT By the way, Reagan&&&&&Library is absolutely awesome; and Air Force One so cool. You should definitely go! #GOPDebate Look at Ben Carson with this pinstripe on Here we Goooooo #cnndebate! I'm a lifelong GOP voter but if @realDonaldTrump is the nominee I will&&&&&stay home.

Shut up! Learn how to&&&&&get ratings from FOX! HOLY MOTHER OF DAVROS IS THERE A LADY AT THE #CNNDEBATE FOR #GOPDEBATE HOPEFULS?

You go girl. #alpolitics When you watch Carly Fiorina, remember that HP is about to lay off 30,000 people, partially thanks&&&&&to her policies. #gopdebate Candidates come out at #GOPDebate, but the real debate is if Carly Fiorina's dress is blue or white and gold?? @charleshurt Read your article. Does that mean that no candidates should criticize Fiorina, the failed CEO&&&&&of HP? She's far from impressive. This line up looks like a reunion show for Morning Musume if they all became men... except Fiorina. #GOPDebate Maybe Repubs will respect #Fiorina...nah. I think she's their best shot! #CNNDebate Interesting dress choice&&&&&Fiorina. #GOPDebate #CNNDebate @granadatheater oh noes! Chris Christie is eating Carly Fiorina!
